To get app started run:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Bookshelf

By pressing green circle by the book cover you can change in which bookshelf the book is assigned (currently assigned shelf is marked by green background in a list).

There is 3 bookshelfs:
* Currently Reading - for the books you read now.
* Want to Read - for the books you want/plan to read in the future.
* Read - for the books you already finished reading.
* ( None - will remove book from your list)


## Search

To search for new books and add them to your list press green circle at bottom right.

Type the title you want to find and from the found books list press green button and choose which you want to add to what bookshelf.

Search is available for a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
